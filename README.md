# Cloud-Assignment

First of all, Please refer the Cloud Application doc to understand the use of technologies/tools and the different steps taken in completing this assignment.
It also provides the advantages of using the chosen tech stack to fulfill the business requiremnts. In addition to that, I have provided the screenshots of the
respective tasks.

Then refer the terraform project which creates the Kubernetes cluster in the GCP under : payroll-application/kubernetes_cluster
The overview of different files has been given in the CloudApplication document, the comments has not been mentioned due to time constraints. I can always be reached 
in case anything is unclear.

Then the modified project has been mentioned : react-and-spring-data-rest in which the files - POM file and Application properties file has been modified.

Then for the task of splitting Frontend and Backend, I tried to created a different project for the Frontend, whic has been shared here but due to some unclarity in the
functionality and time contraints I could not create different pipelines.


Thanks.
